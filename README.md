- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin Skladanowski

- 👀 I’m interested in possible aspects of analysis of large scale databases to predict future behaviour of ratios.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a number of things grouped under the definition of "Informatics".
  I target Machine Learning as my expertise area therefore after completing Data Science bootcamp led by Future Collars, I decided to start studying Informatics 
  on the University of Economics in Katowice.
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to building predictive models in any possible area. My current expertise are corporate finance and corporate
  banking. I have been working with numerous corporate clients from different sectors and I am able to gain new knowledge on specifics of different industries.
  Nowadays, I use that to assess financial standing and evaluate companies' value.
